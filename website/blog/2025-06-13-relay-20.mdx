# Version 20.0.0 Release Notes

## Announcement: ESLint Plugin v2.0.0 Released
Relay's ESLint plugin, [eslint-plugin-relay](https://github.com/relayjs/eslint-plugin-relay), was recently updated to v2.0.0. This release includes a number of compatibility updates and removes a couple of deprecated rules. For more info, see the [eslint-plugin-relay changelog](https://github.com/relayjs/eslint-plugin-relay/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Generated Documentation
This release includes a brand new page covering the [Relay compiler config](https://relay.dev/docs/next/getting-started/compiler-config/). This has largely been undocumented so far and now includes autogenerated documentation! We also added tooling to autogenerate API docs from source code. The documentation for [`useRelayEnvironment`](https://relay.dev/docs/next/api-reference/use-relay-environment/) and [`useLazyLoadQuery`](https://relay.dev/docs/next/api-reference/use-lazy-load-query/) are examples of the new autogenerated tooling.

## Breaking Changes
- Deprecate returning non-model weak types from resolvers. If you were using client side resolvers with the `@outputType` directive, these must be migrated to be strong or weak objects. You can continue to use the `@outputType` directive by enabling the `allow_output_type_resolvers` feature flag in the compiler config.
